# Docker Compose Override for M1 Mac (Apple Silicon)
# This file provides optimized settings for Apple Silicon Macs
# To use native ARM64 images on M1 Mac, remove the platform specifications

# Example override for using native ARM64 images:
# services:
#   mysql:
#     platform: linux/arm64/v8
#     image: mysql:8.0
#   
#   redis:
#     platform: linux/arm64/v8
#   
#   api-core:
#     platform: linux/arm64/v8
#   
#   api-legacy:
#     platform: linux/arm64/v8
#   
#   frontend:
#     platform: linux/arm64/v8

# Note: Currently using linux/amd64 with Rosetta 2 emulation for better compatibility
# If you experience performance issues, uncomment the above to use native ARM64 images
